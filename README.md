# online-resume
My resume written in HTML format.

I have been taking an online course for full stack development, which consists of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and it 
seemed like a great opportunity to put some of those skills to use through creating a project which houses my 
resume in HTML format with some CSS styling. I will be updating the project periodically as I learn new skills.
